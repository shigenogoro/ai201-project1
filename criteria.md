# Acceptance criteria — The Unofficial Guide

Five criteria that say what "working" means for this system, written in unit 1
**before** any results existed.

An acceptance criterion names a target: a number, a count, a rate, or something
a person could plainly observe. *"Retrieval works"* is an opinion. *"For at
least 4 of my 5 test questions, the top results include a chunk containing the
answer"* is a criterion.

Under each one, write a sentence or two on **why that target** and not a
stricter or looser one. A reason that says something about your corpus or your
pipeline earns credit; *"80% seemed reasonable"* does not.

> Missing your own targets next unit costs you nothing. Setting a target so
> easy you can't miss it does.

## 1. Retrieved chunks contain the answer - Chunking

For at least 4 of my 5 test questions, the retrieved chunks include one that
contains the answer.

**Why this target:**
<!-- e.g. "One of my questions is about a topic only two documents mention, so
     I expect that one to be hard." -->

---

## 2. Every answer names a source - Generation

Every answer the system produces names at least one source document.

**Why this target:**
<!-- Why all five and not four? What about your setup makes that achievable —
     or what would have to go wrong for it not to be? -->

---

## 3. The relevance gate stops out-of-corpus questions - Gate

When I ask a question my documents clearly don't cover, the relevance gate
stops it and the system returns "I don't have enough information about that" —
in at least 4 of 5 tries.

<!-- The five questions are the ones in `OUT_OF_SCOPE` at the bottom of
     `questions.py`, and `run_eval.py` puts them through the gate and writes
     what happened into your run log. Swap them for your own if you'd rather —
     just keep five of them, or the "4 of 5" above has nothing to be 4 of. -->

**Why this target:**
<!-- What did your distances look like when you set the cutoff in Milestone 4?
     Was there a clean gap, or did the two groups overlap? -->

---

## 4. Chunk size stays in a usable band - Chunking

Every chunk is between 150 and 1000 characters.

**Why this target:**

On the current fixed-width splitter, 6 of my 51 chunks fall under 150
characters — the shortest is 24 (`"d Sundays and after 5pm."`), the leftover at
the end of a document after the last full window, carrying no usable fact. I set
the floor at 150 rather than 200 because some sections here are genuinely short
and still complete: Thornby Wells' "Where to stay" is 176 characters and answers
a real question on its own. The ceiling is 1000 because the longest section
anywhere in my corpus is 711 characters, so anything past 1000 means two
sections have been run together. Nothing here depends on a question or on
retrieval, which is what keeps it independent of criterion 1.

---

## 5. Retrieval survives rephrasing - Embedding

When each of my five test questions is rewritten without reusing any content
word from the sentence that answers it — place names aside — the top result
still contains the answer, in at least 3 of 5 cases.

**Why this target:**

Two of my five questions currently share most of their wording with the
sentence that answers them: question 2 shares five of its six content words
("add", "Brightwater", "estimate", "walking", "winter") and question 4 shares
four of six ("thing", "residents", "recommend", "asked"). A hit on those tells
me nothing about the embedding, because a plain keyword matcher would find them
too — only question 5 has zero overlap, where "best time to visit Corry Vale"
has to reach a sentence reading "May to September." Taking the shared wording
away removes that crutch from two of the five, so I expect to lose one of them
and set this one below criterion 1's 4 of 5. If it lands below 3, the embedding
is doing little that a keyword match was not already doing.

     UNIT 2 — read this before you change anything above.

     If a criterion turns out to be BROKEN rather than merely unmet, you can
     revise it, and that earns credit. But never delete or edit the original
     line. Add the revision underneath it, like this:

         ## 1. Retrieved chunks contain the answer

         For at least 4 of my 5 test questions, the retrieved chunks include
         one that contains the answer.

         **Why this target:** ...

         > **Revised in unit 2:** For at least 4 of 5 questions, the top three
         > results contain the answer.
         >
         > **Why revised:** I couldn't judge "the chunks include one that
         > contains the answer" the same way twice — I scored two questions
         > differently on Monday than on Wednesday. The new version is
         > something I can actually check.

     That's a revision because the criterion couldn't be MEASURED.

     Lowering a target because you missed it is not a revision, and it costs
     you the point:

         ✗ "I said 4 of 5 but got 2 of 5, so 2 of 5 is more realistic."

     A number you missed stays where it is, gets diagnosed, and gets a fix
     attempted. That's where the points are.

     The whole reason the originals stay visible is so someone can see what you
     said before you knew the answer.
